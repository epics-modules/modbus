    The <b>modbus</b> package is based on the <a href="http://isacwserv.triumf.ca/epics/modtcp/TRIUMFmodtcp.html">
      modtcp and plctcp packages </a>written by Rolf Keitel from Triumf. The <b>modtcp</b>
    package was originally converted to Linux by Ivan So from NSLS. <b>modbus</b> was
    extensively re-written for conversion to EPICS 3.14 and to use the EPICS asyn module.
    It now contains little of the original <b>modtcp</b> code, but retains much of the
    original architecture.</p>
  <h2 id="Overview_of_Modbus">
    Overview of Modbus</h2>
  <p>
    MODBUS is an application layer messaging protocol, positioned at level 7 of the
    OSI model, that provides client/server communication between devices connected on
    different types of buses or networks. It is typically used for communication with
    I/O systems, including Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).</p>
  <h3>
    Modbus communication links</h3>
  <p>
    Modbus supports the following 3 communication-link layers:

          RTU</td>
        <td>
          RTU is normally run over serial communication links, i.e. RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485.
          RTU uses an additional CRC for packet checking. The protocol directly transmits
          each byte as 8 data bits, so uses "binary" rather than ASCII encoding. When using
          serial links start and end of message frames is detected by timing rather than by
          specific characters. RTU can also be run over TCP, though this is less common than
          the standard Modbus TCP without RTU. </td>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Serial ASCII</td>

          Serial protocol, which is normally run over serial communication links, i.e. RS-232,
          RS-422, or RS-485. Serial ASCII uses an additional LRC for packet checking. The
          protocol encodes each byte as 2 ASCII characters. The start and end of message frames
          is detected by specific characters (":" to start a message and CR/LF to end a message).
          This protocol is less efficient than RTU, but may be more reliable in some environments.
          ASCII can also be run over TCP, though this is much less common than the standard
          Modbus TCP.</td>

  <h3>
    Modbus communications</h3>
  <p>
    Modbus communication consists of a <i>request message</i> sent from the <i>Modbus
      client</i> to the <i>Modbus server</i>. The server replies with a <i>response message</i>.
    Modbus request messages contain:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An 8-bit Modbus function code that describes the type of data transfer to be performed.</li>
    <li>A 16-bit Modbus address that describes the location in the server to read or write
      data from.</li>
    <li>For write operations, the data to be transferred.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Modbus function codes</h3>

    Other PLC manufacturers will use different Modbus addresses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that 16-bit Modbus addresses are commonly specified with an offset of 400001
    (or 300001). This offset is not used by the <b>modbus</b> driver, it uses only the
    16-bit address, not the offset.

  <h3>
    Modbus data length limitations</h3>
  <p>
    Modbus read operations are limited to transferring 125 16-bit words or 2000 bits.
    Modbus write operations are limited to transferring 123 16-bit words or 1968 bits.</p>

  <h2 id="Driver_architecture">
    Driver architecture</h2>
  <p>
    <b>CAUTION:</b> <b>modbus</b> can provide access to all of the I/O and memory of
    the PLC. In fact, it is not even necessary to run a ladder logic program in the
    PLC at all. The PLC can be used as a "dumb" I/O subsystem, with all of the logic
    residing in the EPICS IOC. However, if a ladder logic program <i>is</i> being run
    in the PLC then the EPICS access with <b>modbus</b> must be designed carefully.
    For example, the EPICS IOC might be allowed to <i>read</i> any of the PLC I/O points
    (X inputs, Y outputs, etc.), but <i>writes</i> could be restricted to a small range
    of Control Registers, (e.g. C200-C240). The ladder logic would monitor these control
    registers, considering them to be "requests" from EPICS that should be acted upon
    only if it is safe to do so.</p>
  <p>
    The architecture of the <b>modbus</b> module from the top-level down consists of
    the following 4 layers:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/R4-29/asynDriver.html#genericEpicsSupport">
      EPICS asyn device support</a>. . This is the general purpose device support provided
      with <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn">asyn</a> There is
      no special device support needed or provided with <b>modbus</b>.</li>
    <li>An EPICS asyn port driver that functions as a Modbus client. The <b>modbus</b>
      port driver communicates with EPICS device support (layer 1) using the standard
      asyn interfaces (asynUInt32Digital, asynInt32, etc.). This driver sends and receives
      device-independent Modbus frames via the standard asynOctet interface to the "interpose
      interface" (layer 3). These frames are independent of the underlying communications
      protocol.</li>
    <li>An asyn "interpose interface" layer that handles the additional data required
      by the underlying communications layer (TCP, RTU, ASCII). This layer communicates
      via the standard asynOctet interface to both the overlying Modbus driver (layer
      2) and to the underlying asyn hardware port driver (layer 4).</li>
    <li>An asyn port driver that handles the low-level communication (TCP/IP or serial).
      This is one of the standard port drivers provided with asyn, i.e. <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/R4-29/asynDriver.html#drvAsynIPPort">
        drvAsynIPPort</a> or <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/R4-29/asynDriver.html#drvAsynSerialPort">
          drvAsynSerialPort</a>. They are not part of the <b>modbus</b> module.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Because <b>modbus</b> makes extensive use of existing asyn facilities, and only
    needs to implement layers 2 and 3 above, the amount of code in <b>modbus</b> is
    quite small (fewer than 2,500 lines).
  </p>
  <p>
    Each <b>modbus</b> port driver is assigned a single Modbus function code. Usually
    a drivers is also assigned a single contiguous range of Modbus memory, up to 2000
    bits or 125 words. One typically creates several <b>modbus</b> port drivers for
    a single PLC, each driver reading or writing a different set of discrete inputs,
    coils, input registers or holding registers. For example, one might create one port
    driver to read discrete inputs X0-X37, a second to read control registers C0-C377,
    and a third to write control registers C300-C377. In this case the asyn address
    that is used by each record is relative to the starting address for that driver.</p>
  <p>
    It is also possible to create a driver is allowed to address any location in the
    16-bit Modbus address space. Each read or write operation is still limited to the
    125/123 word limits. In this case the asyn address that is used by each record is
    the absolute Modbus address.
  </p>
  <p>
    The behavior of the port driver differs for read function codes (1, 2, 3, 4), write
    function codes (5, 6, 15, 16), and read/write function codes (23).
  </p>
  <h3>
    Modbus read functions</h3>
  <p>
    For read function codes (when absolute addressing is not being used) the driver
    spawns a poller thread. The poller thread reads the entire block of Modbus memory
    assigned to this port in a single Modbus transaction. The values are stored in a
    buffer in the driver. The delay between polls is set when the port driver is created,
    and can be changed later at run-time. The values are read by EPICS using the standard
    asyn interfaces (asynUInt32Digital, asynInt32, asynFloat64, etc.) The values that
    are read are the last stored values from the poller thread. The means that EPICS
    read operations are <i>asynchronous</i>, i.e. they can block. This is because although
    they do not directly result in Modbus I/O, they do need to wait for a mutex that
    indicates that the poller thread is done.
  </p>
  <p>
    For read functions it is possible to set the EPICS records to "I/O Intr" scanning.
    If this is done then the port driver will call back device support whenever there
    is new data for that input. This improves efficiency, because such records only
    process when needed, they do not need to be periodically scanned.
  </p>
  <p>
    The previous paragraphs describe the normal configuration for read operations, where
    relative Modbus addressing is being used. If absolute addressing is being used then
    the driver does not create a poller thread, because it does not know what parts
    of the Modbus address space should be polled. In this case read records cannot have
    SCAN=I/O Intr. They must either be periodically scanned, or scanned by directly
    causing the record to process, such as writing 1 to the .PROC field. Each time the
    record processes it will result in a separate Modbus read operation. NOTE: This
    is <b>much</b> less efficient that reading many registers at once with relative
    Modbus addressing. For this reason absolute Modbus addressing with read functions
    should normally be avoided.</p>
  <h3>
    Modbus write functions</h3>
  <p>
    For write function codes the driver does not itself create a separate thread. Rather
    the driver does the Modbus I/O immediately in response to the write operations on
    the standard asyn interfaces. This means that EPICS write operations are also <i>asynchronous</i>,
    i.e. they block because Modbus I/O is required. When the <b>modbus</b> driver is
    created it tells asynManager that it can block, and asynManager creates a separate
    thread that executes the write operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Word write operations using the asynUInt32Digital interface (with a mask parameter
    that is not 0x0 or 0xFFFF) are done using read/modify/write operations. This allows
    multiple Modbus clients to write and read single words in the same block of Modbus
    memory. However, it <i>does not</i> guarantee correct operation if multiple Modbus
    clients (or the PLC itself) can modify bits within a single word. This is because
    the Modbus server cannot perform the read/modify/write I/O as an atomic operation
    at the level of the Modbus client.
  </p>
  <p>
    For write operations it is possible to specify that a single read operation should
    be done when the port driver is created. This is normally used so that EPICS obtains
    the current value of an output device when the IOC is initialized.</p>
  <p>
    Modbus RTU specifies a minimum delay of 3.5 character times between writes to the
    device. The modbusInterposeConfig function allows one to specify a write delay in
    msec before each write.</p>
  <h3>
    Modbus write/read functions</h3>
  <p>
    Modbus function code 23 allows for writing a set of registers and reading a set
    of registers in a single operation. The read operation is performed after the write
    operation, and the register range to be read can be different from the register
    range to be written. Function code 23 is not widely used, and the write/read operation
    is not a good fit to the <b>modbus</b> driver model of read-only and write-only
    drivers. Function code 23 is implemented in <b>modbus</b> with the following restrictions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A driver that uses Modbus function code 23 is either <i>read-only</i> or <i>write-only</i>.</li>
    <li>A read-only driver is created by specifying function code 123 to the drvModbusAsynConfigure
      command described below. The driver will use Modbus function code 23 for the Modbus
      protocol. It will only read registers (like function codes 3 and 4), it will not
      write any data to the device.</li>
    <li>A write-only driver is created by specifying function code 223 to the drvModbusAsynConfigure
      command described below. The driver will use Modbus function code 23 for the Modbus
      protocol. It will only write registers (like function code 16), it will not read
      any data from the device.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Platform independence</h3>
  <p>
    <b>modbus</b> should run on all EPICS platforms. It has been tested on linux-x86,
    linux-x86_64, vxWorks, win32-x86, windows-x64, (native Windows with Microsoft Visual
    Studio 2010 C++ compiler), and cygwin-x86 (Windows with gcc compiler and Cygwin
    library).
  </p>
  <p>
    The only thing that may be architecture dependent in <b>modbus</b> is the structure
    packing in modbus.h. The "#pragma pack(1)" directive used there is supported on
    gnu and Microsoft compilers. If this directive is not supported on some compilers
    of interest then modbus.h will need to have the appropriate architecture dependent
    code added.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Creating_a_modbus_port_driver">
    Creating a <b>modbus</b> port driver</h2>
  <p>
    Before <b>modbus</b> port drivers can be created, it is necessary to first create
    at least one asyn TCP/IP or serial port driver to communicate with the hardware.
    The commands required depend on the communications link being used.</p>
  <h3>
    TCP/IP</h3>
  <p>
    For TCP/IP use the following standard asyn command:
  </p>
  <pre>drvAsynIPPortConfigure(portName, hostInfo, priority, noAutoConnect, noProcessEos)
</pre>
  <p>
    Documentation on this command can be found in the <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/R4-18/asynDriver.html#drvAsynIPPort">
      asynDriver documentation</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following example creates an asyn IP port driver called "Koyo1" on port 502
    at IP address 164.54.160.158. The default priority is used and the noAutoConnect
    flag is set to 0 so that asynManager will do normal automatic connection management.
    The noProcessEos flag is set to 1 because Modbus over TCP does not require end-of-string
    processing.
  </p>
  <pre>drvAsynIPPortConfigure("Koyo1","164.54.160.158:502",0,0,1)
</pre>
  <h3>
    Serial RTU</h3>
  <p>
    For serial RTU use the following standard asyn commands:
  </p>
  <pre>drvAsynSerialPortConfigure(portName, ttyName, priority, noAutoConnect, noProcessEos)
asynSetOption(portName, addr, key, value)
</pre>
  <p>
    Documentation on these commands can be found in the <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/R4-29/asynDriver.html#drvAsynSerialPort">
      asynDriver documentation</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following example creates an asyn local serial port driver called "Koyo1" on
    /dev/ttyS1. The default priority is used and the noAutoConnect flag is set to 0
    so that asynManager will do normal automatic connection management. The noProcessEos
    flag is set to 0 because Modbus over serial requires end-of-string processing. The
    serial port parameters are configured to 38400 baud, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop
    bit.</p>
  <pre>drvAsynSerialPortConfigure("Koyo1", "/dev/ttyS1", 0, 0, 0)
asynSetOption("Koyo1",0,"baud","38400")
asynSetOption("Koyo1",0,"parity","none")
asynSetOption("Koyo1",0,"bits","8")
asynSetOption("Koyo1",0,"stop","1")
</pre>
  <h3>
    Serial ASCII</h3>
  <p>
    For serial ASCII use the same commands described above for serial RTU. After the
    asynSetOption commands use the following standard asyn commands:</p>
  <pre>asynOctetSetOutputEos(portName, addr, eos)
asynOctetSetInputEos(portName, addr, eos)
</pre>
  <p>
    Documentation on these commands can be found in the <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/R4-29/asynDriver.html#DiagnosticAids">
      asynDriver documentation</a>.</p>
  <p>
    The following example creates an asyn local serial port driver called "Koyo1" on
    /dev/ttyS1. The default priority is used and the noAutoConnect flag is set to 0
    so that asynManager will do normal automatic connection management. The noProcessEos
    flag is set to 0 because Modbus over serial requires end-of-string processing. The
    serial port parameters are configured to 38400 baud, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop
    bit. The input and output end-of-string is set to CR/LF.
  </p>
  <pre>drvAsynSerialPortConfigure("Koyo1", "/dev/ttyS1", 0, 0, 0)
asynSetOption("Koyo1",0,"baud","38400")
asynSetOption("Koyo1",0,"parity","none")
asynSetOption("Koyo1",0,"bits","8")
asynSetOption("Koyo1",0,"stop","1")
asynOctetSetOutputEos("Koyo1",0,"\r\n")
asynOctetSetInputEos("Koyo1",0,"\r\n")
</pre>
  <h3>
    modbusInterposeConfig</h3>
  <p>
    After creating the asynIPPort or asynSerialPort driver, the next step is to add
    the asyn "interpose interface" driver. This driver takes the device-independent
    Modbus frames and adds or removes the communication-link specific information for
    the TCP, RTU, or ASCII link protocols. The interpose driver is created with the
    command:</p>
  <pre>modbusInterposeConfig(portName, 
                      linkType,
                      timeoutMsec,
                      writeDelayMsec)

  <h3>
    Modbus register data types
  </h3>
  <p>
    Modbus function codes 3, 4, 6, and 16 are used to access 16-bit registers. The Modbus
    specification does not define how the data in these registers is to be interpreted,
    for example as signed or unsigned numbers, binary coded decimal (BCD) values, etc.
    In fact many manufacturers combine multiple 16-bit registers to encode 32-bit integers,
    32-bit or 64-bit floats, etc. The following table lists the data types supported
    by <b>modbus</b>. The default data type for the port is defined with the modbusDataType
    parameter described above. The data type for particular record can override the
    default by specifying a different data type with the drvUser field in the link.
    The driver uses this information to convert the number between EPICS device support
    and Modbus. Data is transferred to and from EPICS device support as epicsUInt32,
    epicsInt32, and epicsFloat64 numbers. Note that the data type conversions described
    in this table only apply for records using the asynInt32 or asynFloat64 interfaces,
    they do not apply when using the asynUInt32Digital interface. The asynUInt32Digital
    interface always treats the registers as unsigned 16-bit integers.

    Note for Wago devices</h3>
  <p>
    This initial read operation is normally done at the same Modbus address as the write
    operations. However, Wago devices are different from other Modbus devices because
    the address to read back a register is not the same as the address to write the
    register. For Wago devices the address used to read back the initial value for a
    Modbus write function must be 0x200 greater than the address for the write function.
    This is handled by adding this 0x200 offset for the readback address if the plcType
    argument to drvModbusAsynConfigure contains the substring "Wago" (case sensitive).
    Note that this does not affect the address for Wago read functions. The user must
    specify the actual Modbus address for read functions.</p>
  <h3>
    Number of drvAsynIPPort drivers for TCP
  </h3>
  <p>
    Each drvAsynIPPort driver creates a separate TCP/IP socket connection to the PLC.
    It is possible to have all of the <b>modbus</b> port drivers share a single drvAsynIPPort
    driver. In this case all I/O to the PLC is done over a single socket in a "serial"
    fashion. A transaction for one <b>modbus</b> driver must complete before a transaction
    for another <b>modbus</b> driver can begin. It is also possible to create multiple
    drvAsynIPPort drivers (sockets) to a single PLC and, for example, use a different
    drvAsynIPPort for each <b>modbus</b> port. In this case I/O operations from multiple
    <b>modbus</b> drivers can proceed in parallel, rather than serially. This could
    improve performance at the expense of more CPU load on the IOC and PLC, and more
    network traffic.</p>
  <p>
    It is important to note, however, that many PLCs will time out sockets after a few
    seconds of inactivity. This is not a problem with <b>modbus</b> drivers that use
    read function codes, because they are polling frequently. But <b>modbus</b> drivers
    that use write function codes may only do occasional I/O, and hence may time out
    if they are the only ones communicating through a drvAsynIPPort driver. Thus, it
    is usually necessary for <b>modbus</b> drivers with write function codes to use
    the same drvAsynIPPort driver (socket) as at least one <b>modbus</b> driver with
    a read function code to avoid timeouts.</p>
  <p>
    The choice of how many drvAsynIPPort drivers to use per PLC will be based on empirical
    performance versus resource usage considerations. In general it is probably a good
    idea to start with one drvAsynIPPort server per PLC (e.g. shared by all <b>modbus</b>
    drivers for that PLC) and see if this results in satisfactory performance.</p>
  <h3>
    Number formats</h3>
  <p>
    It can be convenient to specify the modbusStartAddress and modbusLength in octal,
    rather than decimal, because this is the convention on most PLCs. In the iocsh and
    vxWorks shells this is done by using a leading 0 on the number, i.e. 040400 is an
    octal number.</p>
  <h2 id="EPICS_device_support">
    EPICS device support</h2>
  <p>
    <b>modbus</b> implements the following standard asyn interfaces:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>asynUInt32Digital</li>
    <li>asynInt32</li>
    <li>asynInt32Array</li>
    <li>asynFloat64</li>
    <li>asynOctet</li>
    <li>asynCommon</li>
    <li>asynDrvUser</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Because it implements these standard interfaces, EPICS device support is done entirely
    with the generic EPICS device support provided with asyn itself. There is no special
    device support provided as part of <b>modbus</b>.</p>
  <p>
    It is necessary to use asyn R4-8 or later, because some minor enhancements were
    made to asyn to support the features required by <b>modbus</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following tables document the asyn interfaces used by the EPICS device support.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b>drvUser</b> parameter is used by the driver to determine what command is
    being sent from device support. The default is MODBUS_DATA, which is thus optional
    in the link specification in device support. If no <b>drvUser</b> field is specified,
    or if MODBUS_DATA is specified, then the Modbus data type for records using the
    asynInt32 and asynFloat64 interfaces is the default data type specified in the drvModbusAsynConfigure
    command. Records can override the default Modbus data type by specifying datatype-specific
    <b>drvUser</b> field, e.g. BCD_SIGNED, INT16, FLOAT32_LE, etc.</p>
  <p>
    The <b>offset</b> parameter is used to specify the location of the data for a record
    relative to the starting Modbus address for that driver. This <b>offset</b> is specified
    in bits for drivers using Modbus functions 1, 2, 5, and 15 that control discrete
    inputs or coils. For example, if the Modbus function is 2 and the Modbus starting
    address is 04000, then <b>offset=2</b> refers to address 04002. For a Koyo PLC the
    X inputs are at this Modbus starting address for Modbus function 2, so <b>offset=2</b>
    is input X2.</p>
  <p>
    If absolute addressing is being used then the <b>offset</b> parameter is an absolute
    16-bit Modbus address, and is not relative to the starting Modbus address, which
    is -1.</p>
  <p>
    The <b>offset</b> is specified in words for drivers using Modbus functions 3, 4,
    6 and 16 that address input registers or holding registers. For example, if the
    Modbus function is set to 6 and the Modbus address is 040600 then <b>offset=2</b>
    refers to address 040602. For a Koyo PLC the C control relays are accessed as 16-bit
    words at this Modbus starting address for Modbus function 6. <b>offset=2</b> will
    thus write to the third 16 bit-word, which is coils C40-C57.</p>
  <p>
    For 32-bit or 64-bit data types (INT32_LE, INT32_BE, FLOAT32_LE, FLOAT32_BE) the
    <b>offset</b> specifies the location of the first 16-bit register, and the second
    register is at <b>offset+1</b>, etc.</p>
  <p>
    For string data types (STRING_HIGH, STRING_LOW, STRING_HIGH_LOW, STRING_LOW_HIGH)
    the <b>offset</b> specifies the location of the first 16-bit register, and the second
    register is at <b>offset+1</b>, etc.</p>

    The asynMask syntax is used for analog I/O devices, in order to specify the number
    of bits in the device. This is required for Modbus because the driver only knows
    that it is returning a 16-bit register, but not the actual number of bits in the
    device, and hence cannot return meaningful data with asynInt32->getBounds().

    means bipolar 12-bit device, with a range of -2048 to 2047)</p>
  <p>
    Note: when writing 32-bit or 64-bit values function code 16 should be used if the

    record is not written to the Modbus device.</p>
  <p>
    Note: On input number of characters read from the Modbus device will be the lesser
    of:<br />
    - the number of characters in the record minus the terminating 0 byte (39 for stringin,
    NELM-1 for waveform) or
    <br />
    - the number of characters contained in the registers defined modbusLength argument
    to drvModbusAsynConfigure (modbusLength or modbusLength*2 depending on whether the
    drvUser field specifies 1 or 2 characters per register.</p>
  <p>
    The string will be truncated if any of the characters read from Modbus is a 0 byte,
    but there is no guarantee that the last character in the string is followed by a
    0 byte in the Modbus registers. Generally either modbusLength or NELM in the waveform
    record should be used to define the correct length for the string.

    Example Applications</h2>
  <p>
    <b>modbus</b> builds an example application called modbusApp. This application can
    be run to control any number of Modbus PLCs.</p>
  <p>
    In the iocBoot/iocTest directory there are several startup scripts for EPICS IOCs.
    These are designed to test most of the features of the <b>modbus</b> driver on Koyo
    PLCs, such as the DL series from Automation Direct.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Koyo1.cmd creates <b>modbus</b> port drivers to read the X inputs, write to the
      Y outputs, and read and write from the C control registers. Each of these sets of
      inputs and outputs is accessed both as coils and as registers (V memory). bi/bo,
      mbbiDirect/mbboDirect, and waveform records are loaded to read and write using these
      drivers.</li>
    <li>Koyo2.cmd creates <b>modbus</b> port drivers to read the X inputs, write to the
      Y outputs, and read and write from the C control registers. Only coil access is
      used. This example also reads a 4-channel 13-bit bipolar A/D converter. This has
      been tested using both signed-BCD and sign plus magnitude binary formats. Note that
      a ladder logic program must be loaded that does the appropriate conversion of the
      A/D values into V memory.</li>
    <li>st.cmd is a simple example startup script to be run on non-vxWorks IOCs. It just
      loads Koyo1.cmd and Koyo2.cmd. It is invoked using a command like:
      <pre>      ../../bin/linux-x86/modbusApp st.cmd
      </pre>
      One can also load Koyo1.cmd or Koyo2.cmd separately as in:
      <pre>      ../../bin/linux-x86/modbusApp Koyo1.cmd
      </pre>
      st.cmd.vxWorks is a simple example startup script to be run on vxWorks IOCs. It
      just loads Koyo1.cmd and Koyo2.cmd.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following is the beginning of Koyo1.cmd when it is configured for serial RTU
    with slave address 1 on /dev/ttyS1. It also shows how to configure TCP and serial
    ASCII connections. (Koyo PLCs do not support ASCII however).</p>

  <p>
    Note that this example is designed for testing and demonstration purposes, not as
    a realistic example of how <b>modbus</b> would normally be used. For example, it
    loads 6 drivers to access the C control relays using function codes 1 (read coils),
    3 (read holding registers), 5 (write single coil), 6 (write single holding register),
    15 (write multiple coils), and 16 (write multiple holding registers). This allows
    for testing of all function codes and record types, including waveforms. In practice
    one would normally only load at most 2 drivers for the C control relays, for example
    function code 1 (read coils), and function code 5 (write single coil).</p>
  <p>
    There are other example applications in the iocTest directory, sim*.cmd and sim*.substitutions.
    These examples are used for testing the different Modbus data types and other features.
    I have used them with the <a href="http://www.modbustools.com/modbus_slave.asp">Modbus
      Slave</a> program, which is an inexpensive Modbus slave emulator.</p>

    (to turn on the output). Each time the asyn record is processed the value will be
    sent to the PLC.</p>

    Differences from Triumf modtcp and plctcp package</h2>
  <p>
    The following are the main enhancements of <b>modbus</b> compared to the modtcp
    and plctcp packages from Triumf:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>modbus</b> supports serial RTU and serial ASCII in addition to TCP. modtcp
      supports only TCP.</li>
    <li><b>modbus</b> supports most Modbus function codes, including 1, 2, 5, and 15 for
      reading and writing coils (single bits) and 3, 4, 6, and 16 for reading and writing
      registers. modtcp supports only Modbus functions 3 (read holding register) and 6
      (write holding register).</li>
    <li><b>modbus</b> supports pseudo-interrupt mode on inputs. The poller thread calls
      device support when there is a new value, so the EPICS records can have SCAN=I/O
      Intr and do not need to periodically read the inputs. This is more efficient.</li>
    <li><b>modbus</b> supports array operations on reads and writes using waveform records.</li>
    <li><b>modbus</b> uses asyn for underlying TCP/IP connections. This reduces the amount
      of code, and has good debugging and connection management.</li>
    <li><b>modbus</b> uses standard asyn interfaces and asyn device support. This reduces
      the amount of code significantly.</li>
    <li><b>modbus</b> should run on all EPICS platforms. It has been tested on linux-x86,
      vxWorks, win32-x86 (native Windows with VC++ compiler), and cygwin-x86 (Windows
      with gcc compiler and Cygwin library). modtcp only works on Linux and vxWorks.</li>
    <li><b>modbus</b> provides EPICS PVs for PLC status and statistics.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following are some drawbacks of <b>modbus</b> compared to the modtcp and plctcp
    packages from Triumf:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>modbus</b> only works on EPICS 3.14, not on 3.13.</li>
    <li>There is no Siemens PLC support. It should be a separate driver, using drvModbusAsyn.c
      as a model. Most code in <b>modbus</b> is Modbus specific, so it is cleaner to write
      a separate, but similar driver for other protocols.</li>
    <li><b>modbus</b> has one thread per asyn port, which is a group of Modbus registers
      or coils. This is more threads than modtcp, which had only 1 thread per PLC. There
      is an advantage in the <b>modbus</b> design, because each can poll at a different
      rate, can have different Modbus function code, and a different data type. It also
      allows much finer granularity in debugging output. But it will lead to somewhat
      increased resource usage compared to the modtcp design.</li>
  </ul>
